## Background

This is the result of a hackathon, where three other 3 team members and I built a demo of an “idea sharing and crowdfunding platform” from 0 to 1 using Figma.**Got 1st prize with $1000 award.**

- A team of 4 people to complete product design with `mind-notes`, `wireframes`, `Figma`, `UML`, and `ERD`. 

- The product is **a website for ideaters to upload video pitches and share with community/audience, especially future investors.**

Designed product structure and functions based on customer demand analysis, with a website map of 8 web pages. 
- Core function including homepage browsing, 
- event organizing, searching, posting, joining team, 
- showcase, 
- pitch managing, 
- user profile managing.

Created multiple user interactions with impressive and unique UX/UI to serve for 4 essential aspect of monetization: 
- community events
- crowdfunding,
- team building
- storytelling.

## Design system


### Colour scheme

{{< swatches "#F6C555" "#986DB2" "#E03C8A" >}}

- **Mustard Yellow( #F6C555)**, our primary color. This attracts attention, especially to our logo and key information. 

- **Deep Green(#986DB2)**, used as Secondary color. It's used for regular buttons, suggesting nature and tranquility.

- To maintain clarity, the background is pure white.  

### Typography

![image-20230820174101658](image-20230820174101658.png)
- **Noto Sans** is the primary choice for many designers due to its lively and contemporary feel, making content approachable "
-  '**Roboto**' for headers, this font brings a modern touch, ensuring that titles stand out with a relaxed yet fitting elegance."

### Button / Card


Using rounded edges on buttons and cards, along with matching color themes, makes things look neat and user-friendly.
