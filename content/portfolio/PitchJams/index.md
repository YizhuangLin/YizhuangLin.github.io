### Colour scheme

**Primary: Goldenrod( #F6C555)**<br>
Goldenrod is a medium shade of gold-yellow that's both striking and gentle. As the primary background color for this project, it enhances the design's vibrancy, harmonizes well with other colors, and complements user-uploaded materials.

**Secondary: Vibrant Pink(#E03C8A)**<br>
Vibrant Pink is a lively, bright shade of pink that exudes energy. It's especially suited for younger audiences, capturing attention as an accent color and pairing well with softer tones for a relaxed visual experience.

**Tertiary: Soft Purple(#986DB2)**<br>
Soft Purple is a refined and elegant shade of purple with a subtle gray undertone. It brings a sense of tranquility to a website and pairs seamlessly as a delicate accent with other hues.


To maintain clarity, the background is pure white.  

### Typography
