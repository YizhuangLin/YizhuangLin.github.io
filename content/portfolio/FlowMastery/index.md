>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals.

This website is designed to help users easily implement the Pomodoro Technique and improve their productivity and focus. It was a group project and my first complete website, for which I was responsible for designing the web pages and creating the landing page.
