>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals.

This website is designed to help users easily implement the Pomodoro Technique and improve their productivity and focus. It was a group project and my first complete website, for which I was responsible for designing the web pages and creating the landing page.

## Colour & Font

The overall design style of the website is quiet, the main color is a **calming blue**, and the font choice is more relaxed **fredoka.**

## Design style

In visual design, I incorporated the keyword "**Flow**" to craft a design that offers users a comfortable website browsing experience. To achieve this, I implemented the following design elements:

- Wavy patterns at headers, footers, and the bottom of windows.
- Uniformly rounded buttons.
- A dotted background around the clock area.

## Desing preview

## Website
The final version of the site has changed a bit from the original design, due to time constraints some design elements were streamlined, and the overall design was modernized with bootstrap to make it more functional.
