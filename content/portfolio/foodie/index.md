## Design system


### Colour scheme

{{< swatches "#f2be22" "#22a699" "#fffff" >}}

- **Mustard Yellow( #F2BE22)**, our primary color. This attracts attention, especially to our logo and key information. 

- **Deep Green(#22A699)**, used as Secondary color. It's used for regular buttons, suggesting nature and tranquility.

- To maintain clarity, the background is pure white.  

### Typography

- **Noto Sans** is the primary choice for many designers due to its lively and contemporary feel, making content approachable "
-  '**Roboto**' for headers, this font brings a modern touch, ensuring that titles stand out with a relaxed yet fitting elegance."
